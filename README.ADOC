= The project :

3b3bot is a fabric mod that turn your account into a chat-based bot on anarchy servers.

I use it to track stats on join.3b3france.fr

== Deploy

=== clone the repo :

`git clone git@github.com:SomeBoringNerd/3b3bot.git`

If needed, edit the code to adapt it to the server of your choice.

=== build :

build the mod, using Java 17 :

`./gradlew build`

=== install the mod :

in the folder build/libs, you'll find several .jar files, move b3bot-1.0.0.jar to your .minecraft/Mods

=== launch the bot :

The prefered way of deploying the bot on a server is using https://github.com/3arthqu4ke/headlessmc[Headlessmc by 3arthqu4ke]

Download the release of headlessmc, and launch it though java -jar

if it's not already done, enter the two following commands on the app :

`download 1.20.1`

and

`fabric 1.20.1`

Once that's done, also download https://github.com/3arthqu4ke/hmc-specifics[hmc-specifics] and put it in your mods folder

restart headless-mc, and enter the command `versions`

you'll have something looking like this :

to launch the correct instance of mc, enter the command :

`launch (the id of the fabric-loader instance) -id -lwjgl`

After the console stop spitting out logs, finally enter the command

`connect (server ip, with port if needed)`

and you are good to go ! check out the commands here :
